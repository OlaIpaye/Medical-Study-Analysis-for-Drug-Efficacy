# **Medical-Study-Analysis-for-Drug-Efficacy**

This project evaluates the effectiveness of two treatments (New and Standard) in reducing blood pressure. Using a dataset of 500 patients (250 per group), the analysis uses statistical tests and visualizations to determine which treatment is more effective.

## **Project Overview**

![python data visualisation using a boxplot](<images/treatment viz using boxplot.png>)

## **Objective**

To assess whether the New treatment significantly outperforms the Standard treatment in reducing blood pressure.

## **Analysis Workflow**

### 1. **Data Exploration**

- Visualized the distribution of blood pressure reduction values using a histogram.

### 2. **Statistical Testing**

- Performed a **two-sample t-test**:
  - **T-Statistic**: -13.76
  - **P-Value**: 0.0 (indicating statistical significance)

### 3. **Visualization**

- Created boxplots to illustrate the blood pressure reduction values for each treatment group.

## **Key Insights**

- **Mean Blood Pressure Reduction**:
  - New Treatment: **7.26**
  - Standard Treatment: **4.87**
- The **New treatment is significantly more effective than the Standard treatment based on the t-test** and visualized through the boxplot.

### **Tools Used**

- **Python**: pandas, scipy, matplotlib
- **Statistical Test**: Two-sample t-test
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Coding the project
- **Git and Github**: Project presentation
- **ChatGPT**: Project breakdown

### **Conclusion**

The New treatment is both statistically and practically more effective in reducing blood pressure than the Standard treatment. This project demonstrates the use of data analysis to derive actionable insights in healthcare.
